##Problem 0
This “problem” focuses on structure of your submission, especially the use git and GitHub for reproducibility, R Projects to organize your work, R Markdown to write reproducible reports, relative paths to load data from local files (if necessary), and reasonable naming structures for your files.

To that end:

create a public GitHub repo + local R Project for this assignment 
submit a link to your website (not your repo) via Courseworks
Your solutions to Problems 1 and 2 should be implemented in your .Rmd file(s), and your git commit history should reflect the process you used to solve these Problems.

For Problem 0, we will assess adherence to the instructions above regarding repo structure, git commit history, and whether we are able to knit your .Rmd to ensure that your work is reproducible. Adherence to appropriate styling and clarity of code will be assessed in Problems 1+ using the homework style rubric.

This homework includes figures; the readability of your embedded plots (e.g. font sizes, axis labels, titles) will be assessed in Problems 1+.

##Problem 1
I have created a personal website at ag2965.github.io 
This website includes a brief introductory landing page, a page giving your academic and professional experience (i.e. a resume), links in the site navigation for your GitHub account (make sure your name and place of work are correct, provide link to website, pin repositories), my email, and other professional networks.

Welcome!
